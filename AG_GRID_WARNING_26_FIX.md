# AG Grid Warning #26 Fix - Grid API Lifecycle Management

## Issue Analysis

**Warning**: `AG Grid: warning #26 Grid API function sizeColumnsToFit() cannot be called as the grid has been destroyed`

**Root Cause**: Race conditions between asynchronous operations and grid destruction, where `setTimeout` callbacks attempted to call methods on destroyed grid APIs.

## Problem Scenarios
1. **Device size changes**: Grid destroyed when switching to mobile, but pending timeouts still execute
2. **Component cleanup**: Component destroyed while timeouts are pending
3. **Rapid resize cycles**: Grid recreation happening while previous grid cleanup is incomplete

## Solution Implementation

### 1. Timeout Management System
```typescript
private pendingTimeouts: Set<NodeJS.Timeout> = new Set();

private safeSetTimeout(callback: () => void, delay: number): void {
  const timeout = setTimeout(() => {
    this.pendingTimeouts.delete(timeout);
    callback();
  }, delay);
  this.pendingTimeouts.add(timeout);
}

private clearPendingTimeouts() {
  this.pendingTimeouts.forEach(timeout => clearTimeout(timeout));
  this.pendingTimeouts.clear();
}
```

### 2. Grid Validity Checks
```typescript
private isGridValid(): boolean {
  return !!(
    this.agGridComponent?.instance?.api && 
    !this.agGridComponent.instance.api.isDestroyed?.()
  );
}
```

### 3. Enhanced Cleanup Process
```typescript
private cleanupGrid() {
  if (this.agGridComponent) {
    this.agGridComponent.destroy();
    this.agGridComponent = null;
  }
  
  // Clear any pending timeouts to prevent calling methods on destroyed grid
  this.clearPendingTimeouts();
}
```

### 4. Safe Grid API Calls
```typescript
// Before fix (unsafe)
setTimeout(() => {
  if (params.api) {
    params.api.sizeColumnsToFit();
  }
}, 100);

// After fix (safe)
this.safeSetTimeout(() => {
  if (this.isGridValid() && params.api) {
    params.api.sizeColumnsToFit();
  }
}, 100);
```

## Key Improvements

### ✅ **Timeout Tracking**
- All timeouts tracked in a `Set<NodeJS.Timeout>`
- Automatic cleanup prevents orphaned callbacks
- Self-cleaning timeouts remove themselves when executed

### ✅ **Grid Validity Verification** 
- Check if grid API exists before calling methods
- Use AG Grid's `isDestroyed()` method as recommended
- Prevent calls on null/undefined APIs

### ✅ **Comprehensive Cleanup**
- Clear all pending timeouts during grid destruction
- Proper cleanup in `ngOnDestroy` lifecycle
- Cleanup when switching device views

### ✅ **Race Condition Prevention**
- Safe wrappers for all async operations
- Consistent timeout management across component
- No more "destroyed grid" warnings

## Testing Results

**Before Fix**: AG Grid Warning #26 appeared during resize operations
**After Fix**: ✅ No warnings, clean grid lifecycle management

## Performance Benefits

- **Memory efficiency**: Prevents memory leaks from orphaned timeouts
- **Clean lifecycle**: Proper grid destruction and recreation
- **Error prevention**: No more attempts to call methods on destroyed grids
- **User experience**: Smooth responsive transitions without console warnings

## Usage Pattern

The fix implements a consistent pattern for all async grid operations:

1. Use `safeSetTimeout()` instead of `setTimeout()`
2. Always check `isGridValid()` before calling grid API methods  
3. Automatic cleanup happens during grid destruction
4. Self-managing timeout lifecycle

This ensures robust grid management in responsive environments where grids are frequently created and destroyed based on device capabilities.
